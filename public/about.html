Our sponsor Paul Gazzilo came to use with a vision of an open source project that will be able to sift through your code in search of security vulnerabilities.
By using github repositiories you will be able to link your github and use our machine learning model to see just how secure your code really is. While this is a good start 
his vision was to also make it a public database so that any new vulnerabilities can be easily added </div>

When thinking about security and how much it is needed you should also think how just how secure the code you write really is. With our senior design project it will be able to help you it your code to the test. 
While this is a good starting point this is a good starting point you yourself will be able to add code to our open source database. Helping to make our app more secure for the vulnerabilities of now and tomorrow.

            With our sponsor Paul Gazzilo we are working together to make a public web app that will be able to introduce security vulnerabilities to any and all projects. 
            Paul Gazzilo's mission with our senior design team seeks to create a reliable place to test for security vulnerabilities. Will this senior deisgn project our mission 
            is to have a database open to everyone to help in the furthering security vulnerabilities.  With this idea we want to be able to further the reach of security assessment for anyone will a github link.
